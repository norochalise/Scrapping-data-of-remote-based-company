7,Gnosis Service GmbH," CoW Protocol lets people swap assets MEV protected at the best exchange rate by leveraging its batch settlement layer built on top of DeFi’s favorite AMMs and DEX Aggregators. Instead of directly executing trades on-chain, users only sign their swap intention and delegate the execution to so-called solvers (aka relayers in other protocols). Solvers bid on the best possible exchange rate in order to win the right to settle trades. By batching multiple trades together in order to create CoWs (Coincidence of Wants), solvers can save on gas costs, AMM fees and execution risk. Therefore CoWs lead to structurally better prices than on any existing DEX aggregator. In the absence of CoWs solvers fall back to using the best possible on-chain route, by comparing quotes from leading aggregators. ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/gnosis-service-gmbh

SaaS is helping tech companies move so much faster, but it’s also introducing a new surface area of risk they’ve never seen before. The risk of leaking sensitive data. As a result, companies are faced with answering the difficult question of how to manage compounding security risks as they grow without introducing more red tape that slows their team members down.At Metomic, we help tech companies save time & reduce costs by minimising their sensitive data footprint in cloud applications like Slack, Google Drive and Zendesk.Our technology includes native integrations with dozens of cloud apps, AI to detect thousands of sensitive data types, and advanced functionality to manipulate data at scale (redaction, retention, access controls, etc). All from one place. This liberates tech companies to make full use of their favourite SaaS apps as they grow, whilst Metomic takes care of all the security risks behind the scenes.After launching our product in April 2021, we now count some of the world’s most innovative companies as customers, such as Zego, Clearcover, Omnipresent, Travelperk and Jumio.

59,Angela Ardolino," The Pet Cannabis ExpertAngela Ardolino is a holistic pet expert who has been caring for animals for over 20 years. Angela owns and operates Fire Flake Farm, her animal rescue farm, as well as her two locations of a natural pet salon and shop, Beautify the Beast, and is co-founder of CBD Dog Health, which offers high quality, all-natural medical cannabis products designed specifically for pets.Born and raised in Miami, Florida, Angela also founded the House of Alchemy, LLC, Miami Children’s Theater, and Tampa Bay Parenting Magazine. In 2013, Angela was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and knew that she needed to find alternatives to the toxic medications being offered to her. After hearing of the benefits of CBD oil and experiencing the life-changing results first hand, Angela set out to destigmatize medical cannabis and CBD oil so she could spread awareness around its holistic healing powers.After Floridians voted to legalize medical cannabis in 2016, Angela sold Tampa Bay Parenting Magazine and hosted the Canna Conference, an educational event to bring together doctors, veterinarians and patients to learn about the positive effects of medical cannabis. During that time, Angela also earned a professional certification in Medical Cannabis for therapeutic use from the University of Vermont, College of Medicine. Since receiving her certification, Angela became active in Women Grow and United for Care, and became an advocate for safe, natural, ethically grown hemp and medical cannabis for human and animal use.Today, to see Angela on her rescue farm surrounded by animals, is to truly see her in her element. Looking at this furry, joyful family, you would never suspect that Angela and her pets were once full of aches, pains and anxiety. Angela is the mother to Odie (12-year-old mini-schnauzer), Nina (8-year-old Doberman), Jolene (7-year-old mutt), Maza (7-year-old mutt), Rhemi (8-year-old poodle), Potato (15-year-old shih tzu) and Miss Daisie (15-year-old black lab), plus 4-10 more dogs, 23 ducks, 19 chickens, 9 geese, 1 bunny and a pig that she is fostering or boarding at Fire Flake Farm. Building The TeamWhile the government battled about growing hemp, Angela spent two years searching for ethical, safe hemp farmers in Colorado, where growing hemp was legal. She also spent that time finding trusted partners, sourcing the best hemp and essential oils, and building her team. In June 2018, with the passage of the Farm Bill, which legalized hemp farming in all 50 states, Angela was finally able to obtain safe, non-GMO hemp grown in the U.S. in Colorado and released CBD Dog Health products.Angela and her team of experts, Hernando Umana and Carter Easler, travel all over the country with The Healing Naturally Tour, educating veterinarians and pet parents on the incredible benefits of cannabis medicine.

We are primarily focused on Shopify, the fastest-growing e-commerce platform. But our goal is to expand further and make our services available to anyone through a headless approach. Digismoothie is all about e-commerce. We carve our long-term experience into our public apps and tailored online stores. Everything we build needs to provide added value for the end-user – the store owner.At the end of 2018, we launched our first public app called Candy Rack. In the next two years, we added several other apps. And most recently, we have begun building online stores from scratch.This year we plan to launch several other public apps and, more importantly, explore the headless commerce space. And that's why we need your help.Why DigismoothieWe are a team of people who love e-commerce and helping our clients to succeed. Basically, we are all Shopify ambassadors to some degree. We have solid experience from well-established companies like Google, Avast, Isobar, or Expando. And that's why we are looking at e-commerce from a global perspective and always aim high.Our apps and online stores have a tangible impact on clients' businesses. Often seen immediately. There is no doubt we genuinely help and create additional value for our clients. That's also why some of the leading brands trust us.We are no startup, ""business as usual"" company, or even corporate. We are a dynamic company that combines the best from each world. A company where people enjoy working and create additional value.We don't have any external investors (neither are we looking for any). Everything we do is bootstrapped. We do things our way – things that just make sense to us and our clients. Common sense and customer-centricity are our fundamental values. Besides that, we are also helping others in need and respect our planet. That's why this year we aim to become a carbon-neutral company.Why ShopifyShopify is by far the world's most popular e-commerce platform. It is serving more than 1.5 million online stores. It looks great, runs seamlessly, and store owners don't need any technical knowledge to manage and operate it.And if some feature is missing, it's likely to be found at the Shopify App Store. There are more than 5 000 public apps, including the ones from Digismoothie.Shopify is growing super fast, and we firmly believe that it will become a tier-1 e-commerce player like Amazon or Alibaba in a few years. If you haven't heard about Shopify yet, they have been mainly focusing on the Northern American market. But their time in Europe (especially the eastern part) will likely come.Digismoothie AppsIn the Apps unit, we build applications for the global market that any merchant can use. Candy Rack and Gift Box are our flagship solutions. But we also create locally specific solutions, like Balikobot or Fakturoid for the Czech market. As of now, our apps are actively used by more than 6 000 store owners globally.Every app we launch needs to look beautiful, have a great and straightforward UX and provide sufficient value to the store owner. And we do excel in that as our average rating on the Shopify App Store is 5.0 (out of 5).Digismoothie AgencyThe business unit called Agency is focused on developing tailored online stores. Our clients are primarily from the Czech Republic (for now). We typically help with everything from the initial design to final implementation and optimization. Besides that, we can also help with migrating the existing store on a different platform to Shopify.We can also provide custom development capabilities for minor changes to the existing store. Or even develop a whole new functionality.Even though this is the newest part of our company, operating just a few months, we managed to acquire a few local well-known clients like Fabini or Tlusty Leatherworks.Who we are looking forWe are constantly looking for people with personal opinions and fresh ideas.

306,Flightcontrol," Flightcontrol is solving the huge gap between Heroku and AWSToday there is a big tradeoff between Heroku (and it’s derivatives) which is easy to use but very limiting and restricting, and AWS which gives you full power and control but is a nightmare to use. We solve this by providing a layer on top of a company’s own AWS account that makes it very easy to use while still letting them pop the hood and leverage the raw power of AWS directly.The classic problem with things like Heroku is that you inevitably reach a point of scale at which you outgrow Heroku and have to undergo a time consuming and expensive migration to AWS directly. So our approach is to bring the Heroku style DX (or better!) to your own AWS account. With Heroku you have their custom layer of infrastructure between you and AWS. But with Flightcontrol, there is no custom infra — it’s just pure AWS and your services can scale as much as AWS can scale.Our approach is to take the best AWS services (like Fargate and RDS), make them extremely simple and easy to use, and give you the very best in class setup possible. For example, we automatically configure Cloudfront in front of Fargate services. And since you own the infra, you can go into AWS to tweak and customize anything you need.So far our customers are in love with the product, saying things like “you’ve nailed the simplicity without sacrificing control” and “this is probably the best way I’ve ever deployed my software”.Last fall we started building Flightcontrol, got accepted into the Y Combinator Winter 2022 batch, and raised a $1M preseed round.We launched the second week of January and now already have 19 paying customers live in production. Most of these are companies with brownfield apps that they’ve migrated from Heroku, Render, Vercel, or their own custom AWS setups, including kubernetes.In March, we grew from 11 to 19 paying customers and doubled the AWS resources we’re managing for customers.Here at the end of March, we just finished the Y Combinator batch and completed raising an additional $2.2M seed round.We have amazing investors, including Matt Biilmann (Netlify), Doron Sherman (VP of DevRel, Cloudinary), Randall Kent (Cypress.io), Zach Holman (#9 at Github), Nader Dabit (former AWS), Brian Douglas, Swizec, and Shawn Wang (swyx).

Our response to this unique moment is to enable the next generation of no-code entrepreneurs and no-code builders to create products better and faster than ever imagined.As demand for custom software continues to ""eat the world"", we aim to be the standard for building amazing products, and for making a living as a no-code builder anywhere in the world, regardless of background.The problem we're solving:Software is eating the world... but software development is broken.Software powers today’s economy but the way it is created is still stuck in the dark ages. Writing millions of lines of code to build products results in a process that is slow, expensive, unreliable, and inaccessible to most. Those familiar with software development know to expect:6-12 months to hire: With nearly 1 million unfilled developer positions in the US alone, building a team requires months of recruitment efforts and deep pockets.3x budget & timeline overrun: Development projects are notorious for running well past deadlines and budgets. Insiders refer to the ""rule of pi"" — multiply the original estimate by 3.14...50% - 80% failure rate: Even small development efforts face complexity, technical hurdles, scope creep, and other project risks.

733,Inex One," When my co-founders Max, Mehdi, Josefine and I started Inex One in Stockholm early 2018 we set out to improve global knowledge sharing. Knowledge (in the form of research reports, access to experts, data etc.) is still hard to come by: it’s expensive, siloed and hard to find. If you have ever wondered why management consultants exist this is one of the reasons - they have access to data that no one else has.The expert network industry is one of those industries that almost no one has heard of, but still has an enormous impact. In short it’s all about helping organizations get in contact with experts to provide insights and information. It is also an industry with huge margins, lots of inefficiencies and a pricing model (huge up-front contracts) that keeps smaller organizations out. This is where we decided to start.On the surface this might seem like a pretty dull industry. I strongly disagree, but never mind that, dull is a good place to be as a startup. The anonymous, dull and high margin parts of the B2B world is where a startup can succeed without giving away the entire company to VCs and without waiting 10 years for profitability.During the past three years we've helped organizations small and large come in contact with thousands of experts. We have a small and effective team that believes in working smarter, not harder. It's amazing what a small team of focused and capable individuals can accomplish through effective teamwork. We don't have many meetings, and most of our work happens asynchronously on GitHub and Slack. Everyone is included and can see every discussion or decision they want to contribute to.Right now I think Inex is really at a sweet spot. Small enough that every team member can have a significant impact. Large enough that we can offer a stable working environment, competitive salaries, solid project management and well defined tasks. Close to profitability, growing steadily with strong investor backing. We are now focused on growing into a stable and profitable company without additional external investment.

No one person can come up with a perfect solution, be it about technology or user experience. We strive to listen to everyone and co-design the product across engineering, design, and beyond.Trust. We trust each other to do their best and to know how to execute within their role and beyond. So we never micromanage — instead, we agree on scope and let each team member be responsible for execution … and expect everyone to ask for (and get) support when they need it.Mastery. We care about quality and detail, because we care about our audience. We push ourselves and question our assumptions. We always experiment and keep learning, individually and as a team.Ambition.

839,Let's Get Digital," How Let's Get Digital came to beLet’s Get Digital was born in March 2020 out of an urgent need for reinvention. Dutch founders Bas & Ruben saw EventInsight, their successful international event business, crumble within weeks during the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Under pressureWith physical events not being allowed for the foreseeable future, the team had to develop an entirely new business model – fast!After some soul searching, the founders had their eureka-moment: rent a farm camping for the entire team, quarantine there and use their event app as a basis for a completely new virtual event platform. A platform that didn’t look like the umpteenth video conferencing or webinar software, but one that would allow users to feel like they were present in real life. This also aligned with their mission to be future proof before 2022 and their deep-rooted passion for the environment. After all, virtual events prevent a lot of CO2 emissions.Shipping the product in 21 daysLet’s Get Digital, the initial battle cry for the new project, became the new company name. Pitches were made and events were planned. Wasting no time, the team managed to ship a solid product within 21 days.  It became a success story that changed the outlook of the team too. “Despite the environmental aspect, I was a true believer of physical events before all this. I thought virtual ones could never garner the same type of engagement,” Founder Bas explains.“But after experiencing so many successful virtual events with our platform, I feel that virtual and hybrid events will remain the new normal, even after the pandemic. It’s just so much easier to attract a larger audience without damaging the environment.”  ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/let-s-get-digital

Our focus is on unorganized smallholders. We offer a different way of addressing sustainability—an approach that highlights what producers are doing well, while encouraging a deeper understanding and commitment to solving the most challenging sustainability issues.Our ApproachWe provide producers with free verification of their sustainability practices. We collect data and share insights that allow partners to benchmark practices and interpret sustainability results in a local context. We promote honest conversations among producers, buyers, and the trade, supported by a common understanding of issues in the supply chain. These are the starting points, we believe, for meaningful change and impact.We have developed a new methodology for conducting farm- and processor-level assessments, adapted for a wide range of producer types and tailored to local conditions. We take a statistically robust approach to sampling and data quality monitoring—from geospatial analysis to on-the-ground observations—in order to offer assurance and insights with high levels of confidence.

We ensure that we connect outside as well as inside to learn from others and inspire each other.We hold ourselves accountable for delivering results. We choose to not to be a victim of circumstance. We make decisions and take responsibility so that we can act & support each other, rather than adopting defensive, and “finger pointing” behaviors.As leaders we motivate and engage our teams to undertake beyond what they originally thought possible, by developing our teams and creating the conditions for people to grow and empower themselves through enabling and coaching.

Do you care about user privacy, open source software, first class user experience, and developing new technologies that will benefit millions of users?Without communication as a first class citizen, many actions taken for granted on the Internet cannot take place in web3. Users can’t receive direct communications related to their savings, loans, and financial positions. They can’t receive information from projects they care about in the context of how they interact with them. They can’t contact others in their community, for example, to make an offer to purchase a digital collectible. Businesses can’t receive receipts for payments, or invoices. Developers can’t be reached in the event of security issues and can’t send out important communications to their users if there is an issue, upgrade, or decision to be made.Mailchain provides a cross protocol platform for sending and receiving messages between blockchain addresses. Users don’t need to reveal private keys or any other information about themselves. It’s as simple as using webmail.Mailchain's ValuesWe obsess about our users: They are the reason we exist and the source of our motivation. We love uncovering and solving users’ most important, most urgent, and most valuable problems. We work on what matters most to them today, never making short term decisions to sacrifice long term success.We think big but start small: We love to take on big challenges. We break problems down into solvable pieces and look for simple solutions. If the right solution doesn't exist yet, we will invent it. When a better solution comes along, we will replace what we have.We make everyday count: We start every day with a clear purpose, and are thoughtful and deliberate about what we do. We don’t wait for the right moment, we create it. We maintain focus and see things through to completion. We re-evaluate our priorities regularly to adjust to the changing needs around us. To constantly be our best selves, we remind ourselves often that we're on a long journey and it's important to re-energise, recover, and reflect regularly.We go further together: We work as a team and succeed as a community.

1438,CoPilot," Why we created CoPilotSo. It’s time to get a new car.It’s not like buying a cup of coffee—or even a TV.The car you choose is going to take you to work everyday, pick up your kids from school, and get you to your summer vacation. You’re going to live with it–and pay for it–for a long time, so you really want to get it right.So why is shopping for a car… not so great?It’s exciting at first, but it quickly starts to feel overwhelming and out of your control: there are 6 million cars for sale out there. Over 1000 models. And lots of technical terms that nobody except the insiders understand . You’re never sure if you’re missing out on a better car or a better deal, and in an industry built on commissions, it’s hard to get advice you can trust. It feels like a world built so the insiders always win while outsiders like you don’t even speak the language. It doesn’t make sense. You’re the one spending the money, shouldn’t you be the one in control?That’s why we created CoPilot - an expert assisted car shopping experience - to serve as your personal expert for all things related to your car. Your CoPilot has your back every step of the way - from trim to transmission, to loans and insurance, even maintenance down the road. Your CoPilot does all of the legwork and research so you don’t have to - you get reliable, personalized advice on everything you need–and everything you don’t–enabling you to find that “hidden gem” - the perfect car for you at the perfect price.We’re called CoPilot because we’re 100% on your side. We’re the only app out there that doesn’t get paid by dealers to influence the cars that you see. Instead, we only get paid when you succeed: through tips from happy customers, or by saving you more money on big purchases like insurance–saving you money by tapping into the combined buying power of our growing CoPilot community. Because we’re not just here to help you buy a car, we’re here to be your CoPilot on everything you need for your car and more–today, and for years to come.Something went wrong with car shopping a long time ago. And it’s time to rethink how the whole thing works. Because when you’re buying something this big, you should feel confident you’ve made the right choice…and drive home the winner…CoPilot ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/copilot

1529,The Explanation Company," At The Explanation Company, we are setting out to tackle a challenge of enormous size—we’re building out search for children. Children have been left behind by web browsing and we are going to fix this. By making it possible for children independently look up anything they're curious about, we think this will be one the most important tools ever built. Children have already submitted more than a million questions to us, so we know what they're eager for. We are building creation tools for making narrated visual explanations, and we are recruiting a community of explainers to create explanations for every question.We're a well funded startup so we have the runway to pull this off, but we're early in building the team. Our culture is fast-paced, focused on getting things done. We make big plans, identify the core assumptions in those plans, and take small steps quickly to try and validate those assumptions. The amount of work we need to get done with the small team we have is a little nuts, so we have to find clever shortcuts to pull this off. If you're looking for work-life balance, this isn't the place. At this early stage you'll have a big scope of responsibility, but it also means that things will come up at odd hours and you'll be the go-to person for those.Our culture is one where the fun of the work comes from solving hard problems with amazingly talented colleagues. If your core motivation is to ""work on something that's good for the world"", this is not the place for that. That's not our lens so it would be better to find an education or healthcare startup. We are a proud for-profit company, although with a very-long term mindset. We'll achieve our impact by reaching as many children as we can, while generating a healthy profit in the process.

1599,Luke Walker," Hi, I'm Luke. This is a Hail Mary pass, but who knows, maybe the right person will read it and both of our lives will change forever :)Let's see...First, a bit of background - I'm originally from the UK, I did the ""digital nomad"" thing for a while and eventually settled in Thailand. In the last 9 years I've built 2 successful online businesses (and 1 that failed!) and I've gotten pretty good at spotting opportunities and building companies around them.About a year ago, another of these opportunities appeared, and it's got more potential than anything I've worked on before.Myself and my other Co-Founders jumped on it, built an MVP (it's a SaaS product for online creators), and now have some high profile paying customers that have given us amazing testimonials.It's a big opportunity, the MVP works well, customers are happy and paying, and we’re ready to switch on our marketing engine.So what's the problem?None of our Founding team are developers. We outsourced the MVP build to a good friend of mine who is excellent, but he's already committed to his own startup and only took on our MVP project as a favour to me.He's still helping us as much as he can, but everything is moving too slowly.We want someone technical to join our team as a Co-Founder who can commit the same time and energy to it as we are.  Someone with real skin in the game!If you've read this far then maybe that's you?If you're a talented developer looking to join a company where a lot of the early questions have already been answered (what's the idea? who wants this? will they pay for it? how do we go to market? etc.), then please click on the 'Apply for this position' button below to apply for an interview: Thanks, LukeP.S. Thailand is a very nice place to live and we'd love to meet you here one day, but we're happy with a 100% remote arrangement.In short, we don't care where you're from or where you did (or didn’t!) go to school. If you have the skills to develop the product, you know (or can learn quickly) how to hire and manage other developers, and have an entrepreneurial drive and will to succeed, then we'd love to hear from you.Thanks ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/luke-walker

Now more than ever, we rely on shared collaboration platforms and digital workspaces in our professional lives, and yet most of the changes wrought by tech on our home and family lives seem like the accidental effects of broader trends, rather than intentional shifts. Maple, a new startup launching today, aims to change that.Founded by former Shopify product director and Kit (which was acquired by Shopify in 2016) co-founder Michael Perry, Maple is billed as “the family tech platform,” and hopes to ease the burden of parenting, freeing up parents, aunts, uncles, grandparents and kids to spend more quality time together. The startup, which is launching its app on iPhone and Android for all and onboarding new users from its waitlist over the next few weeks, has raised $3.5 million in seed funding – an impressive round for a company just about seven months into its existence. The round was led by Inspired Capital, and includes participation by Box Group, but is also supported by a number of angels who were Perry’s former colleagues at Shopify, including Shopify President Harley Finkelstein.Perry and his co-founder Mike Taylor, who also co-founded Kit, decided to leave Shopify in order to pursue Perry’s vision of a platform that can help parents better manage their family lives – a platform made up of a social layer, a task-focused list of shared responsibilities, and a bourgeoning service marketplace that looks and feels a lot like the ecosystem Shopify has built for empowering e-commerce entrepreneurs. That’s by design, Perry says.Visit us on our socials!https://www.instagram.com/growmaple/https://twitter.com/growmaple ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/maple

2043,Self Publishing School.com," ABOUT SELF-PUBLISHING SCHOOL:Self-Publishing School is an online education company that teaches people how to write, market & publish their first book in as little as 90 days.Then we teach people to use that book to grow their impact, income, or business.Our program is by far the best on the market which is why we have one of the highest student success rates of any online training company. We genuinely care about student results and provide a great avenue for them to be successful.Our company is driven by 2 unique viewpoints:It’s not about the book. It’s about what the book does for you. We believe that “Books Change Lives” and we believe in the power of “Leveraged Impact” (changing lives through books)In going through the process, our students learn a lot about themselves and conquer fears, challenges & limiting beliefs they never knew existed.They’re also surprised by all of the opportunities that pop up once their book is out in the world.The purpose of our company is to disrupt the publishing industry and show people that self publishing is not only an option, it’s the BEST option.The publishing industry is broken. Big publishers are antiquated and inefficient. They take advantage of the people doing the hard work...the authors. Our company exists to show people there is a better way……a way that doesn’t involve: using a publisher, wasting 2 years of your life, giving away all of your creative liberties, giving away all of your book royalties, and relying on a publisher that doesn’t do any marketing for your book.Self Publishing School made the INC 5000 in 2018 (#2,699) and in 2019 (#1,483) as one of the 5,000 fastest-growing private companies in the US.As we always say, “the best is yet to come”. We’re excited to continue climbing & growing thanks to our incredible team & customers.About the team:There are currently 38 full-time and several part-time team members at Self Publishing School working remotely from across the country and around the world.All team members are “A players”, with a love and passion and a drive to do great work and make the world a better place.You won’t find grumbling, negative co-workers here. People at SPS are passionate and excited about what they do!About the culture:Here are the company core values. We call it “The SPS Way”:Honesty & Integrity Always WinFail Fast, Fail Forward, Fail OftenHard Work & Continuous ImprovementEveryone is Responsible for Facilitating ChangeBest Is The StandardAlthough the team is virtual at SPS, the culture is alive and well...often referenced as one of employee's favorite parts about working here.2-3 times a year the team meets in a unique city in the US (sometimes internationally) for a 3-5 day company retreat...planning the next quarter, connecting in person, having fun, and celebrating wins.The environment is very fast paced, and high growth. The company is growing fast, meaning a high level of accountability, responsibility and autonomy for everyone on the team.We’re constantly investing in the training & growth of our team members through book clubs, courses, trainings, and live seminars. All employees are given $15,000+ worth of training and continued education upon being hired with the company.Since you’re working remotely, you can say goodbye to the dreaded commute (meaning more time for family & fun). This isn’t your average 9-5. Hours are somewhat flexible as long as you get your work done. That being said, due to the growth & pace of the company, it’s not uncommon to work 40-50+ hour weeks.Because of the company’s growth & hiring needs, there’s a huge opportunity for advancement and promotion if you’re a fast learner.Overall, the culture of the company is high growth, fun, empowering, and motivating, with support from a world-class team of people who love what they do.In 2019, Self Publishing School was certified as a “Great Place To Work” by GreatPlaceToWork.com.ADDITIONAL INFORMATION:Here is our blog: www.self-publishingschool.com/blogHere is our main site: self-publishingschool.comHere's our other site: SelfPublishing.com ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/self-publishing-school-com

2147,Initialized Capital," $100B in value and just getting startedWe built the team that we wish we had in our corner when we founded our first companies.  Venture is an antiquated industry, so we’re using software to scale the un-scaleable parts of our business in order to better help our founders and make best use of our all-star team’s time. Our partners — leveled up through software — are a hive mind to serve founders, who in turn help us see the future.Our team works together very closely on everything we do – from investing to advising portfolio companies to developing new program ideas. Many of us have different backgrounds, communication preferences, and work styles. Our processes are built to encourage each person to express their unique perspective and for the group to drive to a decision (but not necessarily to consensus).Consequently, our most important value is collaboration – each person needs to have empathy and active listening skills so that we can understand each others’ points of view. We will not always agree but we want to understand the opinion of each team member because each person is bringing unique experience or knowledge to the conversation. It’s worth noting here that our firm values diversity, equity, and inclusion. 50% of our senior investing team is women, family leave is taken by all partners (men or women) and we are always working to improve metrics on other fronts, both within the firm and across the portfolio.Not only do we need people that we are excited to work with, we want people who we enjoy working with. Our team strives to be helpful and responsive to one another and to our founders and LPs. We want hardworking, low-ego individuals that can take ownership of projects large and small and get things done. We move quickly and these traits help us remain agile while also being organized.In many ways we are a startup and you need to be able to deal with ambiguity. It also helps to be self-aware and focused on constant improvement; we always want to know how we can do better and we regularly interrogate our mistakes, errors, or biases to get better results for ourselves and everyone we work with.An important part of the team is for each person to have good judgment and high personal standards. We employ a long-term mindset because we are building a new way of doing venture and we always have to consider how decisions affect the team and the portfolio in the long term.If this all resonates with you, please apply to join our team.

2312,Proton," Proton builds software & services that power over 2000 independent electronic music labels.  Our core business is digital music distribution: helping our clients deliver their catalog to DJ stores like Beatport and streaming platforms like Spotify, while also helping them monetize on social media networks like YouTube & Facebook.  We're also the #1 provider of DJ Mixes to Spotify & Apple Music!Our Mission & VisionSince we started in 2000, Proton’s mission has always been to lead the electronic music industry forward. As a distributor, we look for ways to help our music labels save time, increase earnings, and grow in a reliable & innovative way.  Running a digital electronic music label is a lot of work, but Proton makes it easier, sustainable, and a lot more fun.  Learn more about our product here.The crew that runs Proton also run their own record labels, produce their own tracks, and many of them are DJs too. We're passionate about music and have built Proton to help solve problems that we face every day as music makers and lovers ourselves. Meet the team here!Currently, our main focus is monetizing DJ mixes on Spotify & Apple. Electronic music is primarily consumed in DJ mixes, but most of the places DJ mixes are played do NOT earn any money for music labels or artists. We’re changing that by making it possible & easier for artists & DJs to upload mixes to Spotify & Apple, where everyone involved can actually get paid. Our vision is that eventually, electronic music labels will earn more money from DJ mixes than their unmixed sales and streams. Since the launch of our beta, we've distributed over 600 DJ mixes that have received over 12 million plays. Proton is now the largest supplier of DJ mixes to Spotify & Apple. Check our latest product launch here.Our ValuesThere are a lot of digital distributors out there, but there are none like Proton. Our values set us apart from an industry otherwise obsessed with growth, mired in technical debt, and generally out of touch with actual needs of the electronic music creatives & community.Love & Respect for the Music - At Proton, everything we do is based on a passion and respect for the music & the creatives who make it. While this may sound cheesy, and any music company would say it, these are not hollow words: our love for the music guides everything we do. Our track record speaks volumes: see our greatest hits below!Lead with Integrity & Vision - Proton was born out of a lack of transparency, accountability, and technical leadership in the rest of the electronic music industry. We were upset artists weren’t getting paid fairly, but quickly learned why: it was increasingly difficult for label managers to actually do that in a digital era without the right tools. From our inception, we’ve been devoted to leading the industry forward with a vision for what needs to change: with creative & timely solutions that solve real problems & build trust with artists, music labels, DJs, and their fans.Grow Sustainably - Like our clients, Proton is a true independent. We’re not owned by another company and we’re also fully bootstrapped: this means we are not beholden to investors. While the rest of our industry (monopolies, startups and private equity backed firms) are obsessed with growth and scale, Proton is devoted to sustainable growth that doesn’t compromise our values.  And it’s working: for the last 4 years, our average annual growth has been over 35%.

2437,Keeper Tax," 💸 Keeper Tax With the rise of gig work platforms and side hustle culture, over half of Gen Z workers are now getting paid with 1099 contracts. They might not think of themselves as business owners, but they are expected to file business taxes. This can feel incredibly daunting and frustrating, and Bookkeepers at Keeper Tax help them navigate these complexities. We're building how this new generation of workers does taxes. Traditional tax tools are not prepared for this new generation of independent workers. Traditional business tax concepts like using a separate bank account, quarterly tax payments, and mileage tracking are not what these people signed up for. At Keeper Tax, we're re-designing taxes from the ground up without assuming that the user should have to do any of those things.Today, most gig workers in the US don’t have access to clear tax guidance. Unable to afford an accountant, these 40-50M Americans struggle to find clear answers to simple questions such as: “Is my phone bill tax deductible?”, “Can I write-off my rent?”, and “How do I go about filing quarterly taxes?” This gap in knowledge is costing them hundreds to thousands of dollars per year.Tax-related content on the internet today is awful - full of jargon and overly conservative.  Here’s an example.  In contrast, it'll be your mission to demystify and detangle the tax mess that the IRS created.  Keeper Tax provides clear tax guidance that’s easy to read, jargon-free, helps save money, and is relatable to Gen Z.

2549,"CNC Software, Inc."," In the BeginningFounded in 1983, CNC Software is one of the oldest companies in the PC-based CAD/CAM industry. The company was built on the concept of providing an inexpensive PC-based CAM system at a time when most other systems were expensive CAD-oriented products. CNC Software was one of the first companies to introduce CAD/CAM software designed for both the machinist and the engineer, providing a practical solution to both markets. While the original version of Mastercam focused on two-dimensional (2D) CAM, it was also one of the first micro-based CAM packages to include CAD capabilities. With Mastercam, the engineer could construct his or her own parts quickly and easily as well as machine them, for an affordable price. CNC Software Today Today, the CNC Software, Inc. corporate headquarters and training facility is in a company-owned 53,000 sq. ft. environmentally friendly headquarters located in Tolland, Connecticut.  In addition to the 90+ employees located at our corporate facility, the company has another 100+ employees who work remotely for the Company across three continents. The real backbone of the Mastercam community is our global reseller network, with over 285,000 installations, Mastercam is the #1 CAD/CAM software in the world.  Some of these experts have been with CNC Software since the very beginning. They've helped build shops from the ground up, and have developed a true ""partnership"" with our customers, offering advice, strategy, and experience to Mastercam users around the world. Strengths and Stability As an industry leader for almost 40 years, CNC Software prides itself on meeting the demanding needs of its customers by providing excellent products at affordable prices. We adhere to our strategy of combining superior software programming with practical shop floor experience. We have remained at the forefront of CAD/CAM technology by listening to our customers' needs, being accessible, and most of all, being dedicated to our customers.  Broad Market Reach with an Eye to the Future Mastercam offers solutions for designers and NC programmers in a spectrum of industries, including milling, turning, wire EDM, router programming, plasma cutting, lasers, and 3D design and drafting. CNC Software's customers range from one-person job shops to Fortune 100 manufacturers. The same software that is utilized by corporations such as Boeing, IBM, and Sikorsky is still affordable enough for the small job shop. To ensure a new generation of trained metal and woodworking personnel, Mastercam is available to educational institutions at sizable discounts.         As CNC Software, Inc. and its flagship Mastercam continue to grow and expand into new markets and technology, our focus remains on our customers.

As the first mover on used EV battery analysis, we have the best set of cross-manufacturer battery aging data to develop the most accurate predictive algorithm for future battery life and range. Why are we doing this? Road vehicles represent 20% of carbon emissions globally, and have accounted for the vast majority of transportation emissions increase since 1970. Electrifying passenger vehicles, in parallel with transitioning our power grid to cleaner energy sources, really moves the needle on climate. We’re going to be a critical part of making that shift -- facilitating the secondary market. ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/recurrent

2780,Wicket," Wicket is the world's first  Member Data Platform.Member Data Platforms offer flexibility and choice in a world where traditional Association Management Software (AMS) has left organizations boxed in.The traditional AMS made a lot of sense for a long time. It used to be challenging to connect software systems – integration wasn’t an option. The complexity involved with integrating multiple tools meant that building one system that could ‘do it all’ was the best option available.In the last decade as tools and software evolved, best-in-class tools became available. These tools help you achieve so much more than a module in your traditional AMS; just because your AMS does it all, doesn’t mean it does it good enough. You should be using the best technology and not just locked into what your AMS provides.Today, flexibility is the number one requirement so that you can evolve easily. With a Member Data Platform, your team can evolve the tools they’re using without any disruptions to your members. ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/wicket

2782,SmartLogic," About UsWe are a custom web and mobile application consultancy based in Baltimore, MD. We've been building custom software since 2005, and over the years, we've become a staple in the Baltimore tech community, developing software for local startups and institutions alike. We developed an iPhone app before the App Store and helped our clients understand ""the cloud"" back in 2008. We've built over 150 custom applications for enterprises and startups alike, including successful startups OrderUp (acquired by Groupon), GiveCorps (acquired by Network for Good), and RedOwl Analytics (acquired by Raytheon).As a custom software development agency, we provide a wide range of services including mobile application development, web application development, product design and research, back-end development, DevOps configuration, API development, user testing, and mobile application builds. We have APIs in production that handle over 15 million requests weekly and apps that are delivered in a dozen languages, including Chinese, Vietnamese, and Arabic; we build apps that handle scale gracefully, are stable, and are easy to continue to build on.Much of our work is greenfield — meaning new applications built from scratch — leveraging best-in-class languages, open-source libraries, and processes, including Elixir / Phoenix, Ruby on Rails, React, and React Native. We use agile development processes and consistent communication to ensure that we stay aligned with clients on priorities, budget, and timeline throughout each project.We build custom mobile and web based applications that handle business logic, such as the new digital ticketing system for the Baltimore Water Taxi, Brookes Publishing’s online Ages and Stages Questionnaire, and location-based crime aggregator SpotCrime. Many of our clients have been with us for a number of years, some over a decade; over 40% of our annual revenue comes from repeat customers.We pride ourselves not only on our high standards of code and organization, but also on our communication skills both with technical and non-technical stakeholders. We work with a variety of clients with a range of technical expertise. Some of our clients have no technical staff but need an internal or external tool built, and so we function as their de-facto technical team; others have a robust engineering department but need a project or feature turned around more quickly than they could manage in-house. We’re equally comfortable in both of these scenarios and anywhere in between. We even occasionally provide technical advising for startups and DevOps consulting for complex application architecture builds.While many of our clients are in Baltimore, Maryland, New York, Washington DC, and Virginia, we’ve worked with clients on five continents and the International Space Station.For more on what we can offer, check out our services, method, and case studies.Our TeamWe are a team of engineers; everyone on our team codes (even our Product Designer and our Marketing Manager). Our President is a classically trained engineer; we take our tech very seriously. That being said, we also highly prioritize communication, with a clear understanding that the work of translating between technical and business perspectives is crucial to the success of all of our projects.Our team members come from many different backgrounds; some have traditional engineering backgrounds, some came to mobile and web application development later in life through bootcamps. Some came to us early in their careers, some came here after stints in large organizations. We even ran an Apprenticeship Program in 2018 to help accelerate the careers of three junior developers and close a hiring gap internally.Regardless of background, everyone on our team is constantly learning and growing as a developer and a professional; we pride ourselves on our high quality code and our excellent organization and communication skills.> Learn more about the SmartLogic teamCommunityWe're proud to be a Baltimore company, and you'll find that many people in the local startup and technology communities know who we are.Civic engagement is one of our core company beliefs, and we've been engaged with a number of community initiatives over the years.

3066,AODocs," AODocs is a new generation SaaS document management platform, which helps companies control their documents and optimize their business processes: for example pharmaceutical companies must follow many government regulations in the way they create, review and publish their internal documentation related to new drugs, HR departments must collect and retain employee-related documents in a certain way, bank and insurance companies generate billions of statements of account and other financial documents every year which must be properly archived and retained, etc. and incur multi-million dollar fines if they don’t do it in compliance. The market for this type of solution is estimated at $12 billion in 2019, and is currently dominated by traditional players like IBM, OpenText and Microsoft with products that were born in the 1990’s and still provide a “Windows 95” like user experience. In the 2019 edition of the Gartner Magic Quadrant (the “who’s who” listing the top 20 solutions of the market), AODocs is the only one that has been founded after 2010, meaning that all the other solutions were created at the time when the only meaning of “cloud” was “something that could make rain”. The other major analyst firm, Forrester, has positioned AODocs as the most advanced cloud document management solution on the market, ex aequo with Microsoft SharePoint Online. AODocs is a global, fast-growing company (about 100 people worldwide, mostly in the US, France, and Italy), and while relatively small, is already enterprise-grade. It is used by major companies like Google, Colgate Palmolive, Uber, PwC, Red Hat, Equifax, Whirlpool, Air Liquide, Ascension, as their primary document management platform for business critical applications, after replacing the incumbent technologies like Microsoft SharePoint, Lotus Notes, OpenText.

(Didn't see that one coming, did you?) They vowed never to eat again until they could order their food online. That lasted about 3 hours. But several months later they launched their first version and never looked back. Mostly because their faces are constantly staring at computer screens.From those humble (and hungry) beginnings we have grown to great team (and not too shabby looking -- except for Bob) that provides online ordering services to thousands of restaurants across the United States and Canada. eHungry is often called the ""Shopify for restaurant online ordering."" Okay, nobody really calls us that, but we use the same approach. We're not a portal or directory where customers go to find restaurants and get charged ridiculous fees. We build each restaurant's online ordering experience under their own brand. We're proud to offer a low-cost, feature-rich platform that makes it easy for restaurants to offer mobile and online ordering to their customers.eHungry is headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, but we have team members that live and work all over the world (usually above ground). Except for Bob. He's trying a new underwater co-working space that's all the rage. ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/ehungry-inc

3292,Showcase IDX," For our sister company, eXp Realty, we will be developing a national and international search portal product, while maintaining the growth of our existing business. This is a rare opportunity to join our team at the beginning of a new mission, as we look to redefine how people find and buy homes on a national and eventually international scale. We are rethinking today's generic home search experience and creating a set of next-generation tools that will help millions of people around the world find and buy their next home. To achieve these ambitious goals, we'll be keeping things simple and transparent in the product design, code, and team. We believe that simple can be hard, but simple is worth the effort. It's important to us that work is as enjoyable and drama-free as possible. Not every day will be sunshine and rainbows, but we've got each other's backs, and come together to help each other when we're unsure, stuck, or facing adversity. We like making well-reasoned decisions and making them quickly. We don't particularly like too many meetings, but we love working together to figure things out. We're laid back with each other, don't take ourselves too seriously, and laugh (probably more than we should), but we ship awesome, well-documented, and tested code, often.Our team is made up of experienced, talented people who see opportunities where others may not. We understand that innovation comes from experience, experimentation, iteration, taking smart risks, and rejecting the idea that the status quo is the only or best way to solve a problem. You'll be challenged by big ideas, and have the opportunity to influence a product that truly impacts one of the biggest decisions in people's lives in very real ways. We are picky about our code. We want our codebase to be readable, maintainable, performant, reliable, and well-tested. We encourage use of language features to make code more readable, not overly clever. We aggressively, but nicely, code-review each other. We learn from each other, and push each other to get better.We believe that delivering value outweighs how many hours you work or where you work. In our eyes, the best performance and outcomes come from focusing on our personal and team growth and development. We provide a flexible work schedule, generous vacation, a relaxed work environment, and opportunities for professional growth and development. You'll never be asked to come into an office.Amazing work/life balance - sane & flexible work schedule, generous vacation.Work on interesting technical and product challenges in an environment that encourages creativity, fun, and the use of new tools to deliver the best results.Have the creative freedom for learning, experimenting, and responsible risk-taking in a startup-like environment.Work closely with a small, talented team with a proven track record.Be a central part of a product team that iterates constantly and ships regularly.Contribute to a developer culture that attracts and retains the absolute best engineers through a motivating and rewarding environment. You will help hire, mentor, and motivate an outstanding engineering team.Work on public-facing consumer and b2b products that millions of people use.Spend your day engineering software instead of wasting time in needless meetings.Great benefits like Health Insurance and flexible vacation scheduling.  ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/showcase-idx

Why not build a 100% cloud-based artifact repository? Not only would it bring value to my own engineering team, but it would enable other engineering teams to devote more of their time to doing what's important: building their core businesses.CloudRepo is a sustainable product with happy customers, but growing it to the next level is no easy task — and CloudRepo needs help from someone with a proven track record in driving high volumes of signups to developer tools.CloudRepo is based in Fargo, ND, USA, and is looking for talented people anywhere around the world.Stats we're proud of20M+ requestsCloudRepo has reliably handled over 20 million requests and counting.

3417,Brilliant Metrics," Brilliant Metrics was formed in 2014 by Steve Robinson, a digital marketer and recovering software developer, after successfully coaxing a few traditional marketing clients to venture out of their tried-and-true campaign comfort zone and try something different. He suggested that, instead of time-boxing their efforts and spending all the production budget on the front end of their campaigns, they start smaller and leave time and money to optimize along the way. The results were amazing. Steve wondered, what if all clients worked this way? To find out, he set out to create an agency built around this campaign-killing, optimization-driven, experience-based philosophy.Since then, Brilliant Metrics has grown into a small, talented team of geographically-dispersed professionals. We’ve gathered a loyal roster of clients who value our education, counsel, strategy and execution and see us as the key to getting to the next level in their marketing and business.Internally, Brilliant Metrics attracts individuals with a certain set of values. These core values are a part of who we are, not just a company line. We believe “boss,” “supervisor” and “employee” are dirty words. “To employ” is to use, and human beings should never be used. Likewise, everyone we hire is a responsible adult and shouldn't require supervision or bossing to be successful. We empower each other to meet obligations, and we expect everyone will rise to the challenge and produce results. ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/brilliant-metrics

3471,Able," A better way to build amazing technology teams. Able’s technology teams consist of exceptional product designers, software engineers, product managers, and all-around company builders. The teams we build incubate our own investments and work with our partners to start, accelerate, and grow impact through technology. Our teams are capable of addressing every stage of the technology venture lifecycle; from strategy through design, development, and delivery. They are experienced, driven, and opinionated. On top of that, they enjoy a significant competitive advantage on day one by drawing from our portfolio of proven practices, internal tools, and intellectual property.Why join us?Diversity makes our teams stronger and more resiliant. Diversity adds value to everything we do. We deliberately staff teams with wide ranges of backgrounds and experiences to allow them to bring their own unique ways of thinking and working to each project. And, when our teams face adversity, diversity ensures they do so with greater perspective and capability.Talent is everywhere, opportunity is not. There are talented product-builders everywhere. But often, that talent is sequestered at a BigCo monopoly, squandered at an agency with limited impact, being wagered at a single startup that's taking a huge risk, or can't even get an interview because they don't live in a technology hub like Silicon Valley or New York. Our portfolio model and embrace of remote work lets us pair talented, hardworking people with other talented, hardworking people no matter where they are, and connect them with opportunities to make a greater impact.Craft matters. Writing code and designing at a startup is like trying to paint during an earthquake. Sure, it’s admirable but ultimately the work turns out crooked.Engineering team and processesWe believe in sharing best practices across teams and engaging our collective brain in evolving them based on our experience. We believe in having teams of well-rounded professionals who are able to contribute to multiple fronts as needed.Here're our answers to The Joel Test: 12 Steps to Better CodeDo we use source control? Yes.Can we make a build in one step? Yes.Do we make daily builds? Yes. Every update to a PR triggers a build. And our E2E tests run daily.Do we have a bug database? Yes, we use one of our product studio's project for this. It works for us as an internal issue tracker.Do we fix bugs before writing new code? Yes we do. No major bugs are left open for long, and it’s the Technical Lead’s responsibility to ensure they are addressed.Do we have an up-to-date schedule? Yes. Every team has a schedule sheet the PM maintains.Do we have a spec? Yes, Engineering and Design have worked together extensively in improving the handoff of requirements. Every team has a custom definition of Ready that includes things like how to handoff animations and other key aspects.Do programmers have quiet working conditions? Yes, we even have an extra quiet zone in our Lima office, that will be there for us when it's safe to get back to it, but we believe having quiet working conditions is way more than that, it's mostly generating the space and time to focus, that's why we launched our time management guidelines to be more intentional about the creation of those spaces for focus, project work, company work, self-development, and team building.Do we use the best tools money can buy? Yes, we have top speed MacBooks, GitHub/Slack/Heroku for easy collaboration/deployment, great course subscriptions, and a growing technical library so you can focus on self-improvement.Do we have testers? Everyone is responsible for testing, and we work with both unit and end-to-end tests. We have clear code coverage metrics. We highly encourage testing during code reviews, it's part of our DNA.Do new candidates write code during their interview? Twice. We've received very positive feedback from candidates that complete our interview process and go through our coding evaluations.Do we have hallway usability testing? While this is not officially part of our standards, we've seen many teams engage with this practice proactively.Technical ChallengesFocus on building the stuff that matters, go as fast as you can on the rest. We’re always looking for value. We have our own proprietary libraries of reusable components and workflows to speed up execution and promote focus on problems that matter the most.We build and manage world‑class technology teams. Working with Able brings more leverage with technology on day one. Whether to augment an existing team, spin-up a new independent team, or bring an entirely new product to market, we build a bespoke team that will meet the needs of every business. We have worked with Venture Capital Firms, Private Equity Firms, Family Offices, Nonprofit Organizations, Growth Stage Companies, Venture Backed Companies, Philanthropists, and Entrepreneurs. You’ve heard of our partners. But you probably haven’t heard of us. While we pride ourselves on operating behind the scenes and letting our partner companies shine, there’s a very good chance you’ve used one of the products our team has helped build.Tech stackWorking at AbleEvery Able team member embodies—and emboldens—our five core values.Champion outcomes over effort. We take ownership of problems and emphasize that the results we create are more important than the time we spend or the approach that we take.Contribute to the solution. Our team’s challenges are our challenges and we are responsible for not just identifying issues, but doing whatever we can to help solve them.Put people first. We’re caring, open, and encouraging to everyone we work with.Commit to diversity. We’re contributing to a world where we can be ourselves, together.Get better every day.

3478,Raymon.ai," Raymon is an observability and maintenance platform for Machine Learning applications. ML applications are not ""train once, deploy forever"".

This means their long-term maintenance cost far outweighs their original development cost. Raymon helps you debug and inspect your data, helps you identify problematic slices in your production data, lets you continuously monitor your data for problems, and helps you tag your data for creating ever improving datasets. By doing so, the maintenance cost of ML systems can be lowered significantly and ML engineers are empowered to be more productive and agile.  ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/raymon-ai

3499,JLS Trading Co.," What’s JLS Like?1. You Can Be Yourself. You don’t have to put on a fake, professional face. You can just be yourself. You can talk shit to the CEO, and no one will think anything of it. You don’t have to dress up, or use formal language, or pretend to be something you’re not – you can just be you.2. Major Opportunities for Career Growth. We are not trying to just be a small business. We plan to be doing 9 figures annually in the next few years. We promote quickly once we identify talent. It doesn’t matter what your credentials are – it matters what you get done. If you’re smart, capable, and ambitious, then we will keep giving you more responsibility (and money) until you say uncle. We’re trying to get huge, and if you want to make a difference and be continually challenged with new opportunities, you’re gonna like it here.3. Strongly Anti-BS. Anybody in the company can (and is expected to) tell the CEO when he is wrong. There are no bureaucratic or BS rules getting in the way of getting work done. In fact, it’s mandatory to tell the CEO to go fuck himself within two weeks of getting hired (seriously).4. Complete Work/Life Balance. If you’re routinely working more than 45ish hours, you’re gonna get a friendly talking to. We want you to be operating at 100% capacity, which means that you need to rest.5. Full Time Remote. Work from home 100% of the time. Imagine never having to commute again. Get long stretches of deep, focused work, then play with your dog, all while not wearing pants. Note: This doesn’t apply to inventory/manufacturing jobs, though we wish we could figure out a way to make it work.6. No Micro-Management. Once you’re trained and have demonstrated you know your stuff, we are pretty hands-off. In fact, if you need external management to stay on-task and motivated, we probably aren’t the place for you.7. Flexible Work Hours. This doesn’t apply to all jobs (warehouse/production jobs by their nature have to be more scheduled), but in general, we don’t care if you work 10 hour days 4 days a week or want to catch up on the weekend, so long as you put your hours in and get your work done. Kid sick? No problem. Need a personal day? You got it. Want to start your day at 10 AM like our founder, who also takes a nap every day (he claims he works late, but I’m skeptical)? This is the place for you.8. Supportive Environment. We don’t operate via intense stress or unreasonable top-down deadlines. Everyone wants you to be successful – internal politics are at a minimum here. Everyone works hard, but is 100% happy to help you if you’re running into trouble.9. No Dress-Code. I suppose you technically have to wear clothes, but I can’t say that anyone has tested this rule yet, so it may not officially exist.10. No Assholes Allowed. We try very hard to screen out toxic people before they get in, but in case they slip through, we fire them quickly. Imagine never having to interact with dickheads at work? How nice would your life be? We legitimately offer that.11. Regular Feedback/One-on-Ones. Every employee in the company does a planned One-on-One with their manager weekly or semi-weekly for some roles. We don’t bullshit, so when you’re fucking up, we tell you, so you have a chance to get better. And when you’re doing well, we do our best to tell you, so you aren’t living in constant anxiety.12. We’ll Invest in Your Training. We want you and everyone to get better constantly. You’ll be learning new things all the time, and are strongly encouraged to invest time every day to learn new things, improve your system/work process, and just generally try to make your life easier.  ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/jls-trading-co

3652,Clarity Movement Co.,"  Our CompanyAt Clarity, we strive to empower the world to reduce air pollution. We do that by making it accessible for cities and industries to measure and understand their air pollution issues and take effective action.Today, when cities and industrial facilities want to measure air quality at a site they have to purchase expensive monitoring equipment and invest even more to install it in container-sized shelters and integrate its measurements into their IT system. This is unacceptable because it leads to the inability to monitor air pollution at important sites and ultimately to the inability to manage air pollution.We envision a world where novel sensing technology, IoT and cloud computing simplify air quality measurement, enabling cities and industrial facilities to scale up the number of monitoring sites and take data-driven action. Our Sensing-as-a-Service solution for air quality is currently deployed in over 70 cities across 30+ countries and is changing how municipalities and industrial facilities monitor their air quality.After successfully raising our Series A (a few words from our investors here and here), we are excited to keep building on our current success elevating our product to the next level, at the forefront of the clean air movement. This is especially true of our software products, where we see a significant opportunity to increase the value we provide to our customers as well as to expand the number of use cases supported by our Sensing-as-a-Service solution.Our TeamWe are a diverse group of engineers, scientists, and makers from all around the world who are passionate about what we do and devoted to our mission to improve the world by solving some of its greatest challenges. We believe in solving challenging problems by adopting a growth mindset, by fostering an environment that encourages deep collaboration, empathy, and creativity, and by keeping a good sense of humor. We enjoy philosophical debates as much as nerding out about the soldering talents of our HW engineers or the cool data visualizations we create. Although we always have our mission in mind, we know the path for any startup has ups and downs and we’re more than happy to face them together as a team.

3946,FYI," Work has become fragmented. No single app will ever provide everything a whole company needs.

Self-service, freemium, and SaaS apps have given anyone the ability to easily add another app to their company. Even enterprise companies are struggling as they move to the cloud and realize that shared drives and workspaces are a thing of the past. With this fragmentation, it’s now impossible to see what’s happening at work. FYI brings documents, teams, and tools into a single interface that’s connected to all the software that a company uses.Our StoryFYI is the result of over 500 conversations with customers, thousands of survey responses, extensive competitive analysis, an early prototype that was built in five days, and numerous product iterations and growth experiments. The small remote team at FYI has been hard at work solving a huge problem. FYI was launched in 2018 to help solve the most painful problem people have with documents: finding them. This isn’t just a problem individuals have. Teams and companies have it even worse. FYI co-founder & CEO Hiten Shah has spent over a decade building software products, including Crazy Egg and KISSmetrics. He and his co-founder Marie Prokopets are committed to solving the information mess inside of companies and making FYI the one source of truth for organizations. You’ll be joining as a key member of the team to build the future of how everyone in a company finds and shares information.

By bringing us innovation that improves the lives of every day humans or quite literally saves the planet. Capbase just incorporated a carbon capture startup last week; it will likely fail... but if it succeeds, we can erase years of damage to our environment and reverse global warming.Our universities, labs, cafes, co-working spaces and garages create enormous amounts of innovation—and there are more startups and new innovative technology being created every day. Today’s challenge is harnessing this innovation and using it to advance the human condition.Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon all deliver innovation at scale, across the globe. These companies, for better or worse, have changed how the world works. There are many more companies like them in information technology, hardware, healthcare, and energy, and so on.It might seem impossibly difficult -- many books have been written about how these companies were built and the challenges they encountered along the way -- but the only way for companies to be built and change the world at scale is by starting a startup. All companies start as startups.Our Duty at CapbaseIf startups are capable of achieving global scale and saving the world, and every company started as a startup, then it is our moral duty to remove the barriers to entry for entrepreneurs and anything that stands in the path of innovation.Talented, hard working founders should be able to build a startup and scale their companies, independent of where they live... or their race, their gender, their sexual orientation.That’s our duty at Capbase: to serve the startups that are saving the world. By eliminating the frictions along their way, in the most meaningful way possible. By empowering entrepreneurs to build great products and scale their companies without worrying about legal contracts or financial compliance.It is also the duty of every service provider in the startup ecosystem: investors, incubators, advisors, lawyers, recruiters, etc.Not every company has the opportunity to meaningfully and directly impact the world of innovation and startups in the way that Capbase can. The success of Capbase is tied to our ability to fulfill our duty -- to set up startups for success and help innovative founders succeed in their missions to save the world.We are building a product that will become an essential part of how founders build and scale their startups into world-changing companies. We work for those people. If we do our job well, we’ll create something that matters as much to them as it does to us, and all of our lives (and the world) will be better for it.We have an opportunity that is rare.

My EA and I've been working together for almost a decade. Every month the relationship gets more powerful.3) Delegating: Many people can't even imagine all the things you can accomplish with a Philippines-based EA. We already have.

If you are looking for help short-term, think an AI assistant can offer you what you need, aren't willing to put the hard work in to increase your productivity, or don’t think our pricing is a completely obvious investment, we recommend looking elsewhere.If you’re excited to learn how to delegate 10x more, gain leverage in all areas of your life and build a relationship with an EA that grows more valuable over the course of a decade, we would be thrilled to partner with you.

4128,Snowplow Analytics," The Snowplow StoryThe Snowplow story begins back in 2012 with a passion for behavioral event data and our excitement about what the future holds. At the time, we were advising companies on how they could take advantage of their mobile app and website data about how their users behaved to inform their digital strategy, product development, and marketing.However, we kept bumping into limitations: our clients web and mobile data was “stuck” inside Google Analytics or Omniture (subsequently bought by Adobe). We were not able to perform the analysis we wanted. And it was very difficult, if not impossible, to get the underlying data out of the tools.The idea behind Snowplow was to provide a platform to enable any company to collect their granular behavioral data for themselves, in their own cloud account, so that data analysts and scientists could free themselves from the constraints imposed by the web analytics vendors.Fast-forward ten years and Snowplow is now a thriving and growing product company, but the principles of the beginning remain the same today — we empower companies to track high-quality behavioral event data and use that data to execute all sorts of use cases from complex analytics to real-time recommendations.

4129,Bluesquare," Who we are?We are a diverse group of people: developers, project managers, administrators, analysts and public health specialists from Burundi, Congo, Belgium, France, the USA and many other places. Plus we have a good mix of men and women – not so common in technologFrom our various backgrounds and perspectives, we all contribute to Bluesquare’s mission – getting health resources where they have the most impact.Working with us means you get a chance to do what you do best, and do what you like most, all while making the world a better place for those who need it. What brings us together is a common vision about public health more than an adherence to any specific culture – we hire for culture add, not culture fit.What we do?We work to eradicate sleeping sickness, to help improve access to water and to encourage better prenatal care. We support the work of health workers around the world by providing the tools and processes that make their job more efficient. We believe that through open access to data on their work, they can better serve their communities.Although we do most of our day-to-day work in our various offices, we also value the unique knowledge gained by going to the field. We think it is important to be directly in contact with the people we support. It allows us to better serve them.Where will you work?We currently work from Brussels, Belgium ; Bujumbura, Burundi ; Kinshasa, DRC; Washington DC, USA; Harare, Zimbabwe and Cotonou, Benin. Many of us are also frequently in the field, meeting users and stakeholders. This means that we’re used to remote working environments. We conduct most meetings or other activities through conference calls and are generally “remote friendly”.Depending on your own location, preferences and roles, we’ll discuss with you what works best. If you are a distance remote worker, we will likely propose that you work a few weeks out of our office in Brussels to get started.For people applying outside of our Brussels office, we especially look for self-directed, highly-empathetic people – we think those qualities are good for everyone, but especially useful for remote workers.This also means that we have a relatively flexible “work from home policy” for all.

4136,Freedom of the Press Foundation," Our MissionFreedom of the Press Foundation (FPF) is a 501(c)3 non-profit organization that protects, defends, and empowers public-interest journalism in the 21st century.The organization works to preserve and strengthen First and Fourth Amendment rights guaranteed to the press through a variety of avenues, including the development of encryption tools, documentation of attacks on the press, training newsrooms on digital security practices, and advocating for the public’s right to know.Freedom of the Press Foundation is built on the recognition that this kind of transparency journalism — from publishing the Pentagon Papers and exposing Watergate, to uncovering the NSA’s warrantless wiretapping program and CIA secret prisons — doesn’t just happen. It requires dogged work by journalists, and often, the courage of whistleblowers and others who work to ensure that the public actually learns what it has a right to know.Our WorkWe accomplish our mission in several ways:SecureDrop. We lead the development of SecureDrop, an open source platform for secure communication between sources and media organizations, and we support its adoption by newsrooms around the world. SecureDrop is available in 10 languages and used by more than 70 media organizations world-wide, including The New York Times, The Washington Post, Associated Press, The Intercept, USA Today, CBC, and The Guardian.Digital Security Trainings. We conduct in-person digital security trainings with journalists and filmmakers to help teach them about digital security tools and offer them the best available technologies to protect themselves and their sources.U.S. Press Freedom Tracker. In partnership with the Committee to Protect Journalists, we run the US Press Freedom Tracker, a website for monitoring press freedom violations in the United States. This nonpartisan news website is the first to provide reliable, easy-to-access information on the number of press freedom violations in the United States—from journalists facing charges to those stopped at the US border or physically attacked while on the job.Encryption Tools & Special Projects. We also build a variety of experimental technology projects that aim to protect journalists or promote transparency. In 2017, we helped release an Android app called Haven, which can use the sensors on anyone’s smartphone to act as a security system for your surroundings. The project is open source and does not send any information to the cloud. We also built a Twitter bot called FOIA Feed which automatically collects stories that rely on the Freedom of Information Act from over a dozen different news outlets. Additionally, we built a tool that can archive at-risk news outlets which are in danger of being blocked or deleted from the web and it was credited by reporters as being a factor in stopping Peter Thiel from buying and permanently deleting Gawker.News and Advocacy. We engage in public and legal advocacy around critical press freedom issues, including excessive government secrecy, the protection of whistleblowers, the surveillance of journalists, the Freedom of Information Act, and reporter’s privilege.Crowdfunding. Non-profit media, independent transparency organizations, and open-source security tools are increasingly a critical component of the journalism landscape. We aim to broaden the financial base of these types of projects by crowd-sourcing funding and making it easy for people to support the best journalism from an array of organizations all in one place.Our VisionFreedom of the Press Foundation aims to protect and promote the basic human right of freedom of the press, both in the United States, and abroad, in a world where surveillance, censorship, and manipulation are becoming more sophisticated and more pervasive. Public interest journalism — the kind of journalism that holds power accountable and defends human rights — is under threat everywhere.Our goal is to ensure that all news organizations worldwide recognize that digital security is a critical press freedom issue in the 21st century. To protect journalists, their sources and their audiences, it is imperative that newsrooms use best-available security tools and practices, including encryption of sensitive communications and materials, anonymization of sources, and distribution of news through secure and censorship-resistant channels.

4138,"Agency, Mai?","  We're a small, distributed European team (Serbia, Romania, Germany, UK, etc.) doing unusual and challenging websites and web-based apps.We like: animations (SVG, JS and CSS) and cool transitions; sites that feel technically slick as well as being beautifully designed; sites that work hard for the client (usually with integrations of CRM systems, HR systems, etc.); WordPress sites that do not look like WordPress sites, and apps which delight our clients. We’re like it when clients say “Wow!” We like it even more when users say “Wow!” The best things we can hear people say are (for a WP site) ""is that even possible with WordPress?! - surely not!"" or (for an app) “well, we couldn’t afford a team, that big” when we know we did it with a small, efficient team. The overall approach is “agency quality, without the agency bull****”, and we tend to have very loyal clients as a result. Our key value is mutual respect. That goes through everything from hiring (we couldn’t care less about the colour of your skin or passport, your family’s religion or your gender – we will not arbitrarily withhold respect from anyone) to team interactions (every member of the team has to have respect for the skills and insights if every other team member) to the clients we choose (if a client doesn’t respect our work or is exploiting their customers then we won’t work with them). Typically our hiring process is: a 30-60 minute informal conversation about what you can do, and what you want, what we have, what we have done, etc., to see if there is a fit (“interview” is too formal a term); the next step would be a 60 minute coding test to do in your own time; then the next step would be some sort of test project. If we get as far as the test project then it definitely will be paid for, and it also will be on a live project for a real client, where you interact with the rest of the team, one of our production/PM types, etc.: people should get paid for work, nobody should work for free, and we don’t want to get bogged down in formal hiring processes – we’ll aim to get you on to real work as soon as possible, so that we can find out what you are like to work with and you can work out if you’re happy working with us.  ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/agency-mai-9d95d1dc-f212-4b9a-ab29-82f876304ad6

4470,Metabolic Living," Who Are We and What’s the Company’s Background?Our mission is simple: make living healthy easier than living unhealthy. We do that by empowering people to fix their own health with our metabolism-first approach and unified ecosystem called our MetabolicOS.3 things make us different than other brands in the health and wellness space:1) Metabolism-First – After 11 years of trial-and-error with 500k+ people, we’ve found optimizing your metabolism delivers the results you want: feeling your best, looking your best, performing your best and living longer. Your metabolism is your inner compass for health, but most people don’t understand how to read it; once you do, it’ll tell you exactly what to do to help you thrive.2) Individualized-Approach – Paleo may work great for one person’s metabolism, Vegan for another, Keto for another, etc. Everyone’s different, so to achieve results that stick, those differences must be respected; if not, things will backfire. That’s why our approach is 100% customized to the individual – there is no perfect program to find, it must be built to support how that specific person’s unique metabolism works. This is where the usual one-size-fits-all solutions fail – they don’t respect our very real individual differences.3) Integrated Ecosystem – It’s simply too hard to live healthy – lots of great individual solutions, but nothing is connected. We’re left to stitch everything together, which is confusing. We simplify everything with an integrated suite of the offerings you need to optimize your metabolism. We started with nutrition, then exercise, then supplements, then coaching and are constantly pulling in new pieces of the health puzzle.We power up this 3-pronged approach with our proprietary Metabolic Optimization System (or MetabolicOS) that combines practitioner wisdom and scientific research with ML/AI to deliver a truly customized data-driven consumer experience.Our vision is to do this by becoming a billion-dollar multi-channel brand that reaches people wherever they are - online, in stores, at home, at work, at the doctor or wherever else they seek help. We’ve been painstakingly building the products, services, framework and high-performance culture to make this happen. And now we’re ready for a much larger stage.We’ve built a full ecosystem of products and services that allow someone to live a metabolism-first lifestyle. This includes exercise and nutrition programs, habit change, supplements, functional foods, 1-on-1 coaching, membership programs.What’s Our Past and Future?Our company may be a bit confusing at first glance because we built everything organically in reverse, starting with our first nutrition program in 2012, then our first exercise program in 2014 and then launching our full ecosystem of products, including nutraceuticals, functional foods, subscriptions, memberships, 1-on-1 coaching and more. We market these all separately under different DTC websites.However, now everything’s being centralized under our new brand, Metabolic. We’re launching our flagship e-comm website on Metabolic.com in early 2022 and our fully unified MetabolicOS shortly thereafter. Normally, companies launch with a brand and then figure out how to make money. We did that in reverse – creating products that solve specific problems first, scaling that up to fund building out our team and infrastructure, and then retrofitting the brand on top.Why is a Metabolism-first Lifestyle Needed?Because there are record amounts of sick, overweight, tired and depressed people piling up in virtually every country. Why is that? Because we’re over-worked, over-stressed, over-fed and toxic. And we’re deprived of the sleep, nutrition, exercise, movement and relaxation we need to thrive. That’s a recipe for disaster. And we’re seeing it.Unfortunately, the typical solution of extreme dieting and exercise trap people into a 1-step-forward-2-steps back vicious cycle that actually makes them worse off. They bounce around from one latest flavor-of-the-month program to the next, never making any progress… staying trapped in a downward spiral.Rigid philosophies like Paleo or Vegan, while extremely healthy for some, create an us-vs-them tribal mentality that’s self-limiting. Neither of those philosophies work for all people all the time… or even the same person all the time. People differ. People change. If that’s not respected, things will backfire.We, on the other hand, present a framework that allows you to customize your life in a way that works best for you, so you can reach your fullest metabolic potential. Because we’ve found through working with millions of people that a fully optimized metabolism is what delivers the results you want: to look better, feel better and do better.Instead of fighting against your body or your life, we teach you to work with your body and life to create the perfect program for you. One that’s practical. One that’s sustainable. One that’s enjoyable. And, most importantly, one that delivers the results you want at any stage of life. And fast.What's it Like Working at Metabolic?We practice what we preach: our company is designed so everyone on our team both enjoys their work challenges while having plenty of time to do what they most in their life. We have rigor to our commitment, practicing ""No Meetings"" before 1 PM every day, and ""Strategic Fridays"", where we focus on uninterrupted work. We even have 1 ""No Meetings"" week a month where we have focused time to GSD. We recruit only high-performing, humble people who produce in fast cycles, hold themselves accountable and have fun. And we invest a TON into our team, mentoring, coaching, teaching high performance habits and more. If you're ready to take back control of your life, live each day on your own terms and make a meaningful impact so that others can live healthier, you've come to the right place.

4601,"Spikeball, Inc"," From our CEO:I launched Spikeball Inc in 2008 with no real clue about starting a business, let alone launching a new sport. Yet, here we are with 4+ million players (all over the world), 24 full-time employees, 150+ tournaments every year, and tons of love from Shark Tank, Casey Neistat, Dude Perfect, The Today Show, Inc Magazine, countless professional athletes and celebrities. I ran it for 5 years as a side business figuring out things like e-commerce, product design, customer service, shipping, finance, and more. My degree in Photojournalism didn’t really prepare me for this. I’d come home from my corporate day job, hang out with my wife and 3 young kids, and once they went to bed Spikeball work would begin. My typical Spikeball shift was 9 pm to 1 or 2 am every night with me heading to a late night post office around midnight to ship that day’s orders. Our first ‘warehouse’ was my basement. I had around 800 sets down there and could fit about 72 sets in my beat up, 1998 Outback (may it rest in peace).  5 years later, in 2013, we hit $1 million in annual revenue with zero full-time employees. At that time, I called up the boss, said “I’m out!”, and went full-time. We’re headquartered in Chicago (not in LA like most of you think) but most of our employees live all over the US. We’re firm believers in live where you want just do good work. The mission of the company is to create the next great American sport. That’s happening through tournaments, pick-up games (you can find them in your area on the Spikeball app), schools, and more.  With that said, THANK YOU for joining me on this ride. Hopefully I'll see you at a tournament or at a pick-up game soon.Much appreciated,SpikeballChris ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/spikeball-inc

4675,Betasmiths ," We get it. Software development is not a walk in the park. Experienced engineers are scarce and it takes time to pull the right team together. Time that's valuable, especially when hitting the market with the right features, right now is so critical. It is always possible to get more junior staff onboard, hack things together, and get it done; but in a few iterations, development just comes to a halt when previous decisions cripple the next feature. It is very frustrating. We know.We know, because we have been there. We live in the trenches, building systems from the ground up, understanding what works and what doesn't. We've witnessed the shifts as technologies evolve. We know because we rally the teams, building them up one member after another, constantly evaluating and encouraging individuals, guiding them to collaboratively succeed. We know because we tried both what worked and what didn't. And we want to share that experience with you.Betasmiths can bridge the gap of what your organization needs to get done during these critical moments as your company hits difficult growth periods. Furthermore, with our experienced engineers we can provide assistance in vetting candidates in interviews, getting the dream team your organization deserves.Each of our member has years of experience in startups and/or well-established companies in Silicon Valley.

Most of our members have practical leadership experience and have our hands in engineering processes, mentoring, interviewing, and hiring.We focus on growing our members coming from traditional full-time engineering companies instead of consulting. We worked in product-focused companies with loads of love and caring to the design and maintenance of the product.

4770,4iiz," Conceived in a busy law practice4iiz was conceived in a busy law practice as it struggled to manage both the practice of law and the business of law.Managing how non-attorneys handled calls, processed leads, and converted calls to clients does not generally have the same appeal as some of the other jobs within a firm.However, when Attorney Bert Diener and Developer Rusty Speedy hyper-focused on building a system to manage intake and retention, the two realized the results were incredible.What began as a challenge to address a systemic marketing-to-sales weakness ended with a process the law firm used to generate over a million dollar of increased revenues in less than eighteen months.Combining an automated intake solution with a continuous improvement process amounts to the quintessential example of a tiny hinge that moves big doors. In developing 4iiz, we understood that software doesn’t magically make all problems go away. What software does is eliminate pain points and make doing things easier. What 4iiz does is make it easier for people to be more disciplined by taking more disciplined action that allows the owner to use more disciplined thought.We are obsessed with why things work and why they don’t. Software Companies that promote themselves on what they can do are ultimately limited in what the people will do. No wonder why so many lawyers are frustrated with promises about some solutions. Its ultimately about people and making is so easy to do what needs to be done, it gets done right.4iiz is not a cookie cutter solution. The core software remains the same but 4iiz believes adapting the software to your firm instead of the other way around. Attorney Bert Diener continues to manage a busy practice multi-state law practice that has employees in several countries. The laboratory that developed 4iiz continues to generate innovation and deep insight into what works and what doesn’t. 4iiz understands the frustrations of managing a law practice and also the possibilities.

Our ultimate intention is to help scale up the protection and restoration of the forests of the planet, which recapture carbon from the atmosphere reversing climate change, and are the holders of the planet’s biodiversity, keystones for maintaining planetary homeostasis. Frameworks introduced by the United Nations allow for the certification of carbon credits from projects that avoid deforestation or accelerate reforestation. However, current methodologies for verification and exchange of these carbon credits lack enough trust, clarity, transparency and efficiency. Combining technologies such as satellite imaging, machine learning and smart contracts we aim to radically improve these processes. In doing so we believe we can help channel billions of additional dollars from organizations and governments seeking to offset their carbon emissions into those protecting and restoring the forest. Our team has a proven track record developing and introducing breakthrough technologies from innovative Silicon Valley companies, having had significant impact on several industries. The company started and is headquartered in California’s Bay Area, but we are creating a globally distributed organization. We are hoping to attract talented people from around the world who feel inspired to contribute to the protection of our living planet. We named the company Pachama, in tribute to “Pachamama”, the goddess of Mother Earth revered by the indigenous people of South America. In Andean mythology Pachamama represents fertility presiding over planting and harvesting, and more deeply the idea that all living beings are deeply interconnected in one web of life, “one spirit”. We hope to honor this idea in our mission and our ways of doing things.To stay informed about our progress sign up to our newsletter.

5095,Sandtex," Organized to Serve Your Needs Sandtex International Corp. was founded in 1993 because we recognized the tremendous growth potential of Mexico and Latin America, growth that would be driven by existing and newly emerging manufacturing and industrial companies. These companies would need support and services in order to operate efficiently and profitably. Mission-Critical Spare parts and equipment are mission-critical for manufacturers. If a machine breaks down, production stops. Workers and machines can sit idle for days or even weeks. Costly raw materials no longer flow through the manufacturing process. Shipments can be delayed. Frustrated customers can become unhappy and begin to complain. They may cancel the order. They may even decide to take their business to one of your competitors. The Right Part When equipment breaks down, only one part will repair it-the right part. Without that part, you can't take care of your customers, and serving your customers is your mission. Getting the right part into your hands is our mission. Buying from the United States Companies in the United States want to do business with companies in other countries. The new Global Economy demands it. Your manufacturing equipment may have been made the United States, so it makes sense that your spare parts come directly from the company that originally made the equipment. But companies in the United States have difficulty dealing with the complexity of selling across international borders. We Are Your Insider You may feel like an outsider when you try to buy from U.S.-based companies. You need their parts. They want your business. But there is a gap between you that can make you feel like an outsider. That is where Sandtex International Corp. comes in. We are your ""inside source"" to help you and your people tap into the U.S. supply system. Your Partner at Sandtex International Corp. When you need parts fast, let Sandtex International Corp. be the first step you take. It is the only step you will need to take. The rest of the steps are up to Sandtex.

5136,Trackly Ltd," For the past 8 years, we’ve worked remotely, running multiple online businesses. Some of them affected tens of thousands to millions all over the world.The biggest problem we faced?Our team members were unproductive and we didn’t have the means to change that. No tools to analyze their activity, no metrics to improve, and no real insights in our hands to act upon.We slowly came by the idea of solving the productivity problems we were experiencing — in order to make life easier for anyone in a similar position.It started by reading plenty of books, studying top performers we look up to. Influential entrepreneurs. Then, we practiced many of their principles on ourselves and our teams. Analyzing the results, doubling down on the things that worked and stopping the things that don’t.Continuous disciplined repetition of this process got us some great results.Some would say that productivity can be summarized in two words: Focus & Intention.However, turning words into action isn’t that simple and many people all over the world are not using their time wisely.Thus,Trackly was born.Trackly is a productivity tracker for teams.

5137,Littlelines," Hi!Let us start by giving a little more information about Littlelines so you have a better idea of our culture. We started the company with a simple mission - to have fun building things for people that pay us to do it - pretty simple. So far, it's worked out pretty well. Since 2007, we've worked with many many clients large and small with many different types of applications - some easy and some challenging. Most of our work has been with Ruby on Rails projects and within the last couple years, we've also have had a few Elixir projects too - though the client adoption has been slower. Our preferred stack is Ruby on Rails / Elixir Phoenix on the backend and Vue.js on the front-end.And not much has changed in that respect in the past fourteen years - we have a healthy set of clients that we work with daily. All of our projects are organized and managed in Asana (https://asana.com). A typical day would be working on the cards you are assigned too, submitting pull requests for peer review, and moving the cards through the kanban board until delivery. All of our clients are on Asana too and are readily available to answer any questions. In some cases, we also have our clients in designated channels in Slack so they feel like they are part of the development team too. Those are basically the only two tools we use for communication.Work/life balance is important to us. We really try to keep focus, as much as possible, on the code. So we keep the meetings to a minimum and have one stand-up meeting once a week via Zoom. A few benefits worth mentioning:1. Work Remotely from Anywhere (Must physically be located in US)2. Health, Dental, Life Insurance and Vision Coverage3. 401(k) through Guidance4 Three week vacations to start - four weeks after the first year of employment.5. Flexible schedule6 No overtime ever7. 100% of expenses when you speak at conferences8.

5183,Zoomforth," Why we started the companyZoomforth started in January 2013. At the time, consumer devices and platforms were increasingly orienting their technology around the ability to create, share and consume rich media. Communicating with photos and videos, for example, was clearly becoming ubiquitous, and a central part of how we'd use the internet to interact. We knew these emerging media types would soon play as important a role in the workplace as they were in consumer life, and saw a big opportunity to help professionals more effectively use content in business-specific ways. So we created a platform that made it easy for professions with no tech or design skills to quickly assemble content into beautiful, branded, secure pages. No more waiting on the IT or creative departments.Our software exists to make the complex simple, and the boring beautiful.The name ""Zoomforth"" was conceived to suggest progress toward new technologies, and to convey the notion of speed and ease... It also happened to be one of the few combinations of any two words that, when combined, generated an available $13 .com domain that we were able to buy. We had humble, if ambitious, beginnings.We had early successes landing some big brands as customers and we raised $1.4M in seed capital (investors include groups like Crosslink Capital and 500 Startups, and angels including the director of Stanford's endowment and the CEO of the NYSE) in order to build the team and flesh out our idea. Ever since, we've grown on revenue, and now we're expanding our team and product to bring powerful web design and communication tools to teams everywhere.Current focus and where we're headedWe started with the belief that business communications would only become more complex with the introduction of new content types and resources, and therefore that digital design would be essential to effective professional communications. That thesis has been proven every bit as true today as it was in 2013, and it's been responsible for our growth. Professionals today - in sales, client communications, learning, and recruiting - are constantly tasked with synthesizing complex information to a variety of different and specific audiences. The status quo is still to send walls of text or PDFs or PowerPoints and, if one needs to package content and resources together into a specific context, to add attachments to an email. Simply put, most professional communications are poorly designed and outdated.There are a number of scenarios in which this is especially true, which are the core use cases for our product, including: enterprise sales proposals, client portals, employee onboarding sites, learning portals, and recruiting pages.In the coming year, we'll be growing our team on the sales and marketing side as well as in product and engineering. We expect professionals in coming years to be confronted with ever more complex concepts to communicate across growing numbers of channels and mediums. And we know that businesses - for security and efficiency reasons - will feel only more urgency to transition to digital technologies and communications infrastructure. We see a clear opportunity to lead the market and help companies use digital design to present information elegantly and effectively.   ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/zoomforth

5234,International NGO Safety Organisation," The International NGO Safety Organisation (INSO) is a British charity that supports the safety of aid workers in high risk contexts.INSO provides registered NGOs with a range of free services including real-time incident tracking, analytical reports, safety related data and mapping, crisis management support, staff orientations and training.INSO services help NGOs with their day-to-day risk management responsibilities and improve their overall situational awareness to support evidence-based humanitarian access decisions. ﻿ContextContemporary armed conflict poses unprecedented challenges to humanitarian organisations in delivering aid to vulnerable populations.Whereas in the context of international armed conflicts aid workers are attributed formally recognised protection under international humanitarian law; today the changing nature of conflicts and the proliferation of non-state armed groups often mean that this assurance is no longer guaranteed.While many NGOs take individual measures to mitigate the risks, coordinated action between agencies - seen by many as the more important requirement -  has lagged behind with no common system at field level prior to INSO.INSO was designed to fill this gap and today serves as the primary safety coordinating mechanism for NGOs operating in high risk contexts. Humanitarian AccessHumanitarian access is the ability of NGOs to reach populations in need as well as the ability of those populations to reach the aid and protection they need. It is a complex and ever changing dynamic involving a host of considerations and challenges.INSO works to support the first side of this equation - NGOs accessing populations in need - by improving situational awareness and enabling humanitarians to make more evidence-based access decisions.Of course, situational awareness alone does not create humanitarian access - and can do the opposite - but where NGOs are seeking to expand access high quality, relevant and up to date safety information has been shown to play a vital role in the process.AccountabilityAny co-operation mechanism is only as good as the participation it enjoys from its members, which is why all INSO platforms are started and monitored by the humanitarian communities they serve through a voluntary Advisory Board.Each Advisory Board represents the NGO community towards INSO in that country and holds concrete powers to set the services and monitor INSO's performance in delivering them.This simple yet highly effective mechanism guarantees transparency, participation and accountability even as the context changes.Internally, INSO ensures the confidential management of information and registration processes and provides a comprehensive internal policy environment that guarantees accountability and protects against risk.ImpactSince 2011, INSO has revolutionized the humanitarian safety coordination sector by introducing a robust and high quality field safety platform model that has been deployed in some of the world’s most high-risk settings.The strong focus on humanitarian principles and exclusive NGO-only membership criteria have caused INSO to become generally accepted as a standard component of modern humanitarian response offering independent frontline reporting and coordination services that save lives, strengthen operational practice and enable humanitarian access.

We're the skunkworks offshoot of an existing logistics company - we founded this startup to address logistics challenges we've faced since we started that company nearly 20 years ago. It turns out most of our competitors face the same problems, and the industry at large isn't making much progress to solve them. So the solutions we're developing are targeting real problems with real monetization potential.

5757,CROmetrics," This document is about the CROmetrics internal culture, and what makes CROmetrics different from other companies. We are inspired in our culture code by Netflix, Hubspot, Atlassian and others who share similar values and cultures.Do Right By The CustomerIf we make our customers successful, we will be successful. Customers being successful will take many forms, so we always seek to add value. This is our most important value and everything else falls from it since no customers = no company.Following in the footsteps of companies like Amazon and Zappos, who are known for fostering cultures where individuals are empowered to wow their customers, we aim to do the same. We believe that customer satisfaction goes beyond delivering to exceeding expectations on a day-to-day basis.We care deeply about our customers’ success. We are in the business of building long-term relationships.We don’t expect our customers to train our people – we are a team of A players and we do the training prior to making them responsible for the customer experience. When we see a customer getting in their own way, we’ll have the uncomfortable conversation about why that might be happening in order to get things back on track. Our best engagements are those where the client views us as an extended part of their team.Customer > Team > Individual The team has to come ahead of the individual since it’s the team that allows us to deliver. By putting the team first, we can jump in and help one another when we notice something amiss, help someone improve where there is an opportunity to do so, etc. By putting the individual last, we avoid the “sharp elbows” so often found inside organizations, particularly consulting firms. On the contrary, we want our team members to help one another deliver better customer experiences, and as a result we are constantly improving in how we deliver customer value.Care personally and challenge directly in communicationsDon’t assume bad intentions over neglect and misunderstanding.a.k.a. Hanlon’s Razor.Recently popularized by Kim Scott in her book Radical Candor, but otherwise known by other names, it’s important to us to have an open, honest ongoing conversation with one another. Radical Candor can be difficult to get used to because often you will find yourself telling someone something they may not want to hear.Radical Candor is about helping your teammate improve. We’ve all experienced bad bosses or people in an organization who are holding the company back and we don’t want to have those people here, as it creates a low performance work environment. We think the best way to solve these issues is to talk about them and give actionable feedback as early as possible.Gossip is not tolerated. The general rule of thumb is that if you find yourself “gossiping” or complaining about someone behind their back (e.g. to another coworker), that is a good sign you should be giving radical candor to the person directly. The recipient of radical candor should be glad to have the feedback and use it to course correct. Realize that feedback needs to be measured at the listener’s ear vs the speaker’s mouth.We reward contrarians. We honor those who speak up at tremendous risk rather than reprimanding or firing them as might be found at other companies. In fact, we require it – those who don’t speak up when they see a problem will be reprimanded. We also have a Radical Candor award that we vote on to give to the person who is best at radical candor.Recognize Emotions are Involved when giving and receiving. Radical candor is absolutely not easy. If done poorly, feelings can get hurt on one or both sides leading to knee jerk reactions which lead to real world consequences. When your feelings are hurt, it is all too easy to assume malice, but Radical Candor at CROmetrics means the person giving it should be caring personally.We Bring Our Pro Gear and Pro AttitudeDerived from classified ads for band members in Seattle, we are a team of people who are serious about the work we do, and we bring our whole selves to work and do a great job for our customers, while also growing in our own careers. CROmetrics strives to be the place where its employees can do the best work of their careers.We are in the business of using data and science to help our customers better understand their customers. Because we are in the business of using data strategically to understand what the customer wants, it is common for us to challenge internally held assumptions as well as get to deeply understand the problems we’re solving for our customers’ customers.We operate well independently. Our clients hire us to get results and drive their business. Our engagements look much more like a partnership than a client/vendor relationship, and as such, we strive to give strategic leverage to the people we work with at our clients at every level. We don’t want our clients to have to spend time “managing us”, instead we want them to look forward to meeting us.We come prepared: We come prepared to meetings, set an agenda, stay within time allocated, articulate next steps, and are focused and decisive.We are an Elite TeamNetflix puts this well: “We model ourselves on being a team, not a family. A family is about unconditional love, despite your siblings’ unusual behavior. An elite team is about pushing yourself to be the best teammate you can be, caring intensely about your teammates, and knowing that you may not be on the team forever.”We do things the right way, or not at all.Performance is measured first by client satisfaction and then company financial performance. We measure hours worked so we can get a sense of effort and improve our performance, but we think hours worked is generally a poor way to measure value delivered to our customers.We prefer guidelines over policies since policies often have the opposite of the intended effect. When our team goes outside the guidelines, it’s generally for a good reason, and we want to support their ability to do that. The cost of mistakes is far outweighed by the additional value we can deliver to our customers by trusting our people to make the right decisions.We expect high performance and give adequate performers a generous severance package.  This can be shocking, but we copied this straight from Netflix.  Hear Reed Hastings, the Netflix founder and CEO, talk about this item in the “culture shock” episode of the Masters of Scale podcast.  He talks about it starting at the 19:18 mark, but the entire podcast is worth listening to.  You can also look at the Netflix culture essay, it’s under the “Dream Team” section.

5758,Learning in Action ," Who is Learning in Action (LIA)?  LIA is a small company with a big vision – a world in which people are present and conscious to the choices they are making and the impact they have on themselves and others -  world in which we are both connected with and separate from each other, recognizing that we make up a whole.  We aim to transform people’s understanding of themselves in a way that creates more choice and more possibility for their lives. LIA is a MD based company, however the company is completely virtual, doing business in all 50 states as well as Canada.   We are tiny, mighty team  - 2 full time staff, one part time staff.   LIA’s Why?We catalyze the advancement of leaders by developing and supporting those who catalyze them. What does that even mean?We believe that we are all shaped in relationship.   Our past relationships shape our perception of the present and our anticipation of the future.  Under stress (and BTW, we are all almost always under stress of some kind), we tend to react in non-conscious ways based upon patterns developed from past relationships.   And we make choices based upon bad or incomplete information, that don’t get us what we want.   LIAT is dedicated to helping people make their non-conscious patterns, conscious, so that they can become aware of them, and have access to more choice and become the person, leader, partner, parent, that they want to be.  We have designed an instrument that reveals our hidden internal patterns under stress, which have evolved over a lifetime, the result of our life experiences.  We train people (coaches, consultants and experts in leadership development) on the interpretation of the instrument and sell the instrument to professionals who provide it to their clients for personal and professional growth.  In this shockingly revealing time in the US, it has never been more important for us as citizens, as a nation to come together.  We believe we have a part in doing that.

Our teams are cross- functional and collaboration is key. Nothing crazy, but useful Basics: We don't count holidays but set a minimum number; You choose your own hard- and software; As a company that has almost, if not more, kids than employees, family-friendliness is crucial to us  and paid parental leave is a no-brainer; We pay monthly perks that cover your costs for working remotely; We meet twice a year as an entire company and (if possible) see conferences as an important place to catch up with team members; We aim to be fully transparent (finance, salaries) unless it hurts people and trust you, based on this to make the best decisionsWe failed in exactly describing our way to approach important company elements that can be described with ‘buzzwords’ such as agile mindset, cross-functional teams, self-organization, value of the individual or trust & teamwork. However, we truly care about them, we live them and we constantly iterate on them.

6351,Pixellu," At Pixellu, we know professional photographers are frustrated with all of the tedious work required to run a successful photography business. Many get so overwhelmed, they end up quitting on their dream of having a photography career. That is why we create easy-to-use, time-saving software that takes the work out of running a photography business so photographers can get back to doing what they love, creating art. Pixellu was co-founded in 2010 by two wedding photographers. Faced with the challenges of long hours and endless tasks, we began asking ourselves, “How can we save valuable time, make more money, and get our lives back?” Our answer was technology. We started Pixellu with the idea that we could make money by providing an honest service that helped photographers save time and live more fulfilling lives. We believed that, by focusing on a great product and great service, we could build a business that not only does good, but also does well.  Today, we are a team of 35 team members spread across 15 countries, serving tens of thousands of photographers in over 100 countries.  Our vision is for Pixellu to become the foundation of more than 1 million successful photography businesses, so that photographers can focus on doing what they love while we automate the rest of their work. We are becoming the bridge between their camera and clients — all they would need to do is upload their photos to Pixellu.  We embrace the spirit of autonomous teams that are empowered to change the photography world while having a healthy work-life balance.  Click here to learn more about us and why you’ll love working at Pixellu.

You will be working with highly competent individuals who take responsibility for their work, and the same will be expected of you.We belong to self-organized teams, so management doesn’t interfere with our day-to-day responsibilities and leadership is situational. You will lead some projects and join others. You will have a great deal of discretion in the work that you do and most of your work will be publicly viewable in the open-source community. Team members are continually learning from each other, and we place an emphasis on sustainable work practices and mental health. We help each other out when the unexpected happens and give kudos and recognition for work well done.Camaraderie is strong, standards are high, and so is the retention rate. We invest in documentation, tests, and automation so that redundant work is minimized and team members can focus on more interesting problems. The work is completely remote – the entire sprint planning process is done asynchronously, and the sprint process itself is iteratively improved. We focus on minimizing meetings so when they do happen it’s for productive reasons. In order to make sure we still get some face time, we schedule optional social events to talk, play games, and engage in other activities. We also meet yearly in person at the Open edX Conference (in non-Covid times!), and use the opportunity to meet everyone, along with the rest of the community, and do a team retreat.OpenCraft runs on the open first principle. Most of our conversations, code, and policies are publicly viewable.Our handbook, like much of our work, is publicly viewable and you can find it at https://handbook.opencraft.com/. You can also visit our forums at https://forum.opencraft.com/.  ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/opencraft

OAMM believes that your work, time and hobbies shouldn’t come at the cost of family and health. Gathering around the dinner table, eating with those you care about and enjoying a nutritious meal is paramount to our mission. Therefore, we create software to further empower individuals to bring back family dinner time without sacrificing the little spare time they have available—giving our users time for what matters most.OAMM began as a mom blog in 2009 with a deep, rich, invested community. Over the last several years it has emerged as a SaaS product fueled by the passions and membership of the community. The technology side of our product is exciting and challenging to build but unlike many other SaaS products, it isn’t the technology that drives the product. The driving force is our community/membership. We believe strongly that these two things, technology and community, have to be in balance and we are looking for a web developer that can respect, appreciate and aspire to help us grow both. OAMM is also committed to steady growth through self-funding as we evolve our product. ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/once-a-month-meals

If there is one thing that we are passionate about, it is great customer service. At The Modern Firm, we take the time necessary to understand our clients' expectations. Once we have that basis, we work to not only meet, but exceed those expectations. Quite simply, we seek out people who love and excel at what they do. Then we trust them to do it. With this simple approach, we create an exciting environment where people who have completely different talents and interests join together to create something that can't be done alone.

6987,Geckoboard," The Geckoboard missionWe’re here to help teams achieve their goals by enabling a fresh way of working. This revolves around a well-defined strategy that’s shared throughout a company, so everyone is on the same page. It allows teams to set clear goals, track their own progress, and have the autonomy they need. It’s something that most companies already aspire to, but are challenged to make a reality.That’s where our dashboards come in. We offer businesses a more effective way to communicate their goals and strategy. We connect teams to the impact of their work and foster an open culture. We help founders and team leaders ensure that important data gets seen and acted on.Geckoboard’s founder Paul Joyce on where it all began...Prior to starting Geckoboard I was a developer, designing and building data warehouses. I could see the enormous potential of data to support teams and individuals in a business. After all, if teams could see the right data at the right time how could it not help with better, faster decision making?But in my experience, this rarely happened. Instead, huge amounts of raw data would be collected, teams of data analysts would use expensive Business Intelligence tools to probe that data for insights, and the end result was often a PDF report or spreadsheet that would go to just a few individuals. Most people within the business never saw key data.Making key data visibleThis was the start of the Geckoboard story; I wanted to create a tool to make the right data visible and understandable for more people in an organization. I wanted to help teams understand the dynamics of their business and open the door to better, more confident decision-making. That was the goal on Day 1 and it’s the same today.What if the old model for data distribution was consigned to the past and instead we had a frictionless way to surface relevant data to more people, in a way they could immediately understand?Paul Joyce- Geckoboard's founderEverything we do is designed to enable this mechanism, from our product to our values and processes.We continue to explore what it takes to unleash the power of data for organizations that are always, at their heart, human. We see dashboards as a data broadcast and distribution tool that fundamentally changes people’s relationship with data for the better. ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/geckoboard

It's a simple service that analyzes your past behavior (which emails you open, which you respond to, how quickly, how often, etc) and determines importance of incoming emails without ever looking at the content (only the headers). It moves unimportant emails out of the Inbox into a separate folder called SaneLater and summarizes them in a digest.  It works anywhere you check your email (since it's just an email folder). After listening to our customers, we built lots of other features:Snooze non-urgent emailsUnsubscribe with 1 clickReminders when people don't reply to youMoving attachments to Dropbox and BoxCustom filtering rules, etcWe're always working on more stuff to help you fall in love with email again ",https://weworkremotely.com/company/sanebox
